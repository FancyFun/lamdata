# Virtual Dog
Data Science code

This simple code is my virtual Dog named Spot. 

Spot is a good dog that is always happy. 

The code takes 3 arguments. Name, age, and happy...

Dogs are always happy so you must put "happy" in that slot

Ex: Spot = Dog("Spot",8,"happy")

I can prove he's happy by calling the function .is_happy() where he will wag his tail. 

When Spot is tired you can call the function, .is_tired() for him to fall asleep. 

When there is an intruder you can call the function bark. Ex: Spot.bark() to send the intruder away.
